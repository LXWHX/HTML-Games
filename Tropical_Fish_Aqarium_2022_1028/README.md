  - Create a vibrant tropical aquarium by adding rocks that emit oxygen and observing the dynamic fish movements.

- **Features**:
  1. **Flocking Behavior**:
     - Fish demonstrate natural flocking with behaviors like cohesion, alignment, and separation.
     - Flocking behavior can be temporarily disabled by holding down any key.
  2. **Random Movement**:
     - Fish move with a natural, random walk pattern when not influenced by flocking.
  3. **Interactive Rocks**:
     - Click on the canvas to place new rocks that emit oxygen, adding visual interest and influencing the fish's environment.
  4. **Dynamic Cohesion and Alignment**:
     - Cohesion and alignment are calculated every second, causing fish to adjust their angle based on their surroundings.
     - Modify the `cohesionDist` parameter to observe changes in the fish's cohesion behavior.

- **Controls**:
  - **Click**: Place a new rock that emits oxygen.
