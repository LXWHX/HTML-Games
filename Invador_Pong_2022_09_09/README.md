## How to Play
- **Goal**:
  - Eliminate all alien invaders.
  - Dodge enemy bombs.
  - Keep all pong balls from falling off the bottom edge of the screen.

- **Hints**:
  1. **Avoid shooting the pong ball**:
     - When a bullet hits a pong ball, two additional pong balls spawn at random speeds and directions, making the game harder to control.
  2. **Do not hold the space bar to shoot**:
     - The number of bullets available is limited, so use them strategically.

- **Controls**:
  - **Arrow keys**: Move the gun left and right.
  - **Space bar**: Shoot bullets (can destroy aliens or interact with the pong ball).
